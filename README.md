# Mico's Religions
## Mod for Religions of Rimworld

Each religion can have a set of variables which indicate what a pawn must do, have, or be in order to join a religion. There’s a lot of stuff to cover. For a brief panic here’s an [example religion template](https://github.com/basarab1504/ReligionsOfRimworld-2.0/wiki/RELIGION-DEF-EXAMPLE). Just check it over and then come back here I’ll explain it.

### ReligionDef [The start]
```xml
<ReligionsOfRimworld.ReligionDef>
		<defName>MechaBretonHive</defName>
		<label>Mecha Breton Hive</label>
		<description>Transhumanists. Metalheads. This technologically minded religion worships the advnacement of humanity into the realms of technology and synthetic materials. The ultimate goal for each individual within the hive is to ascend into a pure robotic body.</description>
		<settingsDefs>
			<li>MBH_JoiningCriteriaSettings</li>
		</settingsDefs>
</ReligionsOfRimworld.ReligionDef>
```

You'll see under `settingsDefs` there can be a list of defs we can point to, which will be all of our special rules for this religion. Right now you see `MBH_JoiningCriteriaSettings` listed there. This is just telling Religions of Rimworld (RoR) that it should look for defNames with the listed names. Let's show you want that would look like:
